With an alarming increase in atrocities across the country, steps ought to be taken to ensure the safety of an individual. Itâ€™s not just women who fall prey to such acts, men are victims too. Technology is often the panacea of many problems. And with an increase in the availability and the usage of smart phones, this is the most sort after way to solve the humongous problem of ensuring safety.In AVI, an Android based mobile application, the physical location of a person is given much prominence.A person in emergency gives a distress call by pressing the alert button. Using GPS, the geographical location of the person who raises the alarm is tracked and the contacts physically closest to the person are alerted with the location of the distress caller. The locations of the user is updated time to time. If none of their contacts are found, the range is expanded. The unique feature added here is alerting the contacts nearest to the user. Timely help at the time of distress is what we aim to provide through the application. and which makes AVI different from conventional safety apps. FUN FACT : AVI translates to "protecter" in Sanskrit...:)
